        <h2>Born Out of Frustration. Driven by Culture.</h2>
        <p>
          I started AfriShip because I saw something broken — and I couldn't ignore it.
          For years, I watched friends and family in the diaspora struggle to stay connected to home. 
          Birthdays passed without Agege bread. Holidays came and went without dry fish, kuli-kuli, or Ankara wrappers.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s when I knew: if nobody would build a shipping solution with Africa at heart, I would.
          AfriShip was born out of frustration — and fueled by love. Love for our people. Love for our culture. 
          Love for what connects us, even when we’re thousands of miles apart.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the first dried fish we carefully packaged to the thousands of boxes we now prepare monthly, 
          every shipment is treated with the kind of care your mama would give it. 
          We partner with trusted logistics teams, and we manage sourcing, labeling, and customs compliance with excellence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, AfriShip serves Nigerians in Europe and North America, helping them send and receive packages 
          of home-grown value — fast, safe, and beautifully packed. We're not just shipping goods. 
          We’re delivering culture, memories, and tradition.
